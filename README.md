# CardputerZero Template Project

A simple starter template for building embedded Linux GUI applications with [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) and CMake.
It is intended to be used as a clean development baseline: desktop builds use SDL for fast UI preview, while device builds use the Linux/LVGL platform drivers.

## Project Overview

In this example project, we used small MVVM-style structure around LVGL:

- **UI layer**: screens and widgets are implemented with LVGL objects. `BaseScreen` owns the page root, title bar, nav bar, and page content. Widgets derive from `BaseWidgets` and expose a `build()` entry point.
- **Data model**: `BaseModel` stores application state such as current page and theme mode.
- **View model**: `BaseViewModel` exposes model state as LVGL observer subjects and provides UI actions such as page switching, counter updates, theme toggle, and quit request.
- **Reactive/data binding**: `src/reactive` wraps LVGL observer subjects and common bindings so labels, styles, flags, widget values, and events can be connected to application state.
- **Data flow**: user input triggers widget callbacks, callbacks update `BaseViewModel`, view model publishes subjects, and bound UI objects refresh automatically through LVGL observers.
- **Platform layer**: platform code owns Linux input integration and other hardware-facing services. The nav bar maps hardware/keyboard keys `4` to `8`, plus `ESC` for quit.

Current demo UI:

- Page 1: Hello World, font weight toggle, LVGL version info, light/dark theme toggle, page navigation.
- Page 2: Counter page, increment/decrement actions with a non-negative lower bound, light/dark theme toggle, page navigation.

### Modules

- `src/app/asset_manager.*`: resolves runtime assets from the optional CMake asset root, source tree `assets/`, and installed `/usr/share/<APP_NAME>/` path.
- `src/app/screen_namager.cpp`: switches LVGL screens when the current page subject changes.
- `src/config/lv_conf_desktop.h`: desktop SDL simulator LVGL settings.
- `src/config/lv_conf_cm0.h`: embedded Linux/CardputerZero LVGL settings.
- `src/platform/linux_input.*`: Linux evdev keypad support and desktop SDL keyboard routing for nav buttons.
- `src/reactive/subjects.*`: typed wrappers around LVGL subjects.
- `src/reactive/bindings.*`: helper bindings for labels, theme, widget values, flags, states, and events.
- `src/view/widgets/navbar.*`: bottom navigation bar and icon-button action mapping.
- `src/view/widgets/icon_button.*`: transparent icon button with font/color/theme support.

## Build Options

Common CMake cache options:

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `USE_DESKTOP` | `ON` | Build SDL desktop simulator when `ON`; build embedded Linux target when `OFF`. |
| `APP_NAME` | `harrison_test` | Application name used by installed asset lookup. |
| `APP_ASSETS_ROOT` | empty | Optional runtime asset root. Expected layout includes `fonts/`, `images/`, etc. |
| `APP_KEY_INPUT_DEVICE` | empty | Optional Linux evdev device path, e.g. `/dev/input/event0`. Empty means auto-scan `/dev/input/event*`. |
| `APP_FRAMEBUFFER_DEVICE` | `/dev/fb0` | Linux framebuffer device used by embedded builds when `APP_USE_DRM=OFF`. |
| `APP_USE_DRM` | `OFF` | Use LVGL's Linux DRM/KMS backend instead of fbdev for embedded builds. |
| `APP_DRM_DEVICE` | `/dev/dri/card0` | DRM device path used when `APP_USE_DRM=ON`. |
| `APP_DRM_CONNECTOR_ID` | `-1` | DRM connector id used when `APP_USE_DRM=ON`; `-1` auto-selects. |

Asset lookup order:

1. `APP_ASSETS_ROOT` when provided by CMake
2. source-tree `assets/` for development
3. `/usr/share/<APP_NAME>/` for installed deployments

## Desktop Builds

Desktop builds are intended for fast UI development and use SDL as the LVGL display/input backend.

### Windows Desktop

Install CMake and Ninja:

```powershell
winget install Kitware.CMake
winget install Ninja-build.Ninja
```

Install a C++ toolchain. Choose one of the following.

MSVC Build Tools:

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.BuildTools
```

In the Visual Studio installer, enable **Desktop development with C++** and make sure MSVC and a Windows SDK are selected.

MinGW-w64:

```powershell
winget install BrechtSanders.WinLibs.POSIX.UCRT
```
Alternatively, you can download from [`winlibs`](https://winlibs.com/). 

Install vcpkg:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git C:\vcpkg
C:\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat -disableMetrics
```

Configure environmental variables for current terminal:

```
$env:VCPKG_ROOT="C:\vcpkg"
$env:PATH="$env:VCPKG_ROOT;$env:PATH"
```

> [!TIP]
> Change `VCPKG_ROOT` to your vcpkg installation directory if it is located elsewhere.
>
> These environment variables are **session-scoped**, meaning they only apply to the current terminal session.
> Once the terminal is closed, the variables will be lost and need to be set again in a new session.
> If you want to a persist environment variable
> ```powershell
> setx VCPKG_ROOT "C:\vcpkg"
> ```


Configure and build with MSVC:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These steps require launching CMake from a **Developer Command Prompt** or **Developer PowerShell** provided by Visual Studio.
>
> This ensures that the MSVC environment (compiler, linker, and Windows SDK paths) is properly initialized.
>
> Without this environment setup, CMake may fail to detect or correctly configure the MSVC toolchain.

```powershell
cmake --preset win32-msvc
cmake --build --preset win32-msvc-dbg
.\build\msvc\Debug\harrison_test.exe

# alternatively for release build
# cmake --build --preset win32-msvc-rel
# .\build\msvc\Release\harrison_test.exe
```

Configure and build with MinGW-w64:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These steps require a properly configured MinGW-w64 toolchain in your system PATH.
>
> Please ensure the following compilers are available in the current terminal session:
> - gcc
> - g++
> - ld
> - ar
>
> You can verify the setup by running:
> ```powershell
> gcc --version
> g++ --version
> ```
>
> If these commands are not recognized, you must add MinGW-w64 `bin` directory to your PATH before configuring CMake.

```powershell
cmake --preset win32-mingw64
cmake --build --preset win32-mingw64-dbg
.\build\mingw64\Debug\harrison_test.exe

# alternatively for release build
# cmake --build --preset win32-mingw64-rel
#.\build\mingw64\Release\harrison_test.exe
```
> [!NOTE]
> `VCPKG` will handle the dependencies during CMake configuration process automatically, 
> this may take several minutes depend on you network connection.

## CardputerZero Cross Build

This preset builds an aarch64 Linux target from a host machine with an `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc/g++` toolchain.
The BSP at `.cache/sdk_bsp-src` is treated as a sysroot: headers, libraries, startup objects, and pkg-config metadata are resolved from that directory first.
If that directory does not exist on the first configure, the toolchain downloads and extracts `sdk_bsp.tar.gz` automatically before CMake runs compiler checks.

Install a cross compile toolchain:

+ Debian

```shell
sudo apt install crossbuild-essential-arm64
```
+ MacOS

```shell
brew install aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, it's recommended to use WSL for cross build
> or you can download [cross compile tools](https://sysprogs.com/getfile/2542/raspberry64-gcc14.2.0.exe) and configure the `PATH` yourself

Configure:

```shell
cmake --preset cp0-cross
```

Build:

```shell
cmake --build --preset cp0-cross-dbg
# or release build
# cmake --build --preset cp0-cross-rel
```

Deploy the release package to your device after filling in your device user and IP:

```shell
REMOTE_USER=<user> REMOTE_HOST=<device-ip> ./deploy.sh
```

By default, the debian package is copied to '$HOME' folder, normally it's under '/home/\<user\>'.

On your device, install the copied package with `apt` and replace the package file name with the one you copied:

```shell
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends ./HarrisonTest_0.0.1_m5stack_arm64.deb
```


## Development Guide

### Navigation Keys

The bottom nav bar maps hardware/keyboard keys from left to right:

| Key | Nav item |
| --- | --- |
| `4` | First icon button |
| `5` | Second icon button |
| `6` | Third icon button |
| `7` | Fourth icon button |
| `8` | Fifth icon button |
| `ESC` | First icon button / quit |

### Adding a Screen

1. Add a new page enum value in `src/model/base_model.h`.
2. Add the page transition/state logic in `BaseModel` and `BaseViewModel`.
3. Create a screen under `src/view/screens/` deriving from `BaseScreen`.
4. Extend `ScreenManager` to load the new screen when the page subject changes.
5. Update `NavBar` icons and callbacks as needed.

### Adding a Widget

1. Derive from `BaseWidgets`.
2. Implement `build()` and create LVGL objects under `parent_`.
3. Use `reactive::bind_*` helpers for text, style, state, or event bindings.
4. Keep LVGL observer lifetimes object-bound whenever possible with `lv_subject_add_observer_obj` or `reactive::observe_obj`.

### Fonts and Assets

Fonts are loaded at runtime through FreeType. Place development fonts in:

```text
assets/fonts/
```

Installed deployments can place fonts in:

```text
/usr/share/<APP_NAME>/fonts/
```

You can also provide an asset root at configure time:

```shell
cmake --preset darwin-arm64 -DAPP_ASSETS_ROOT=/path/to/assets
```


## Debian Package

Debian packages are produced with CPack and written to `dist/`. The package file name follows:

```text
<AppName>_<Version>_m5stack_arm64.deb
```

Default example:

```text
dist/HarrisonTest_0.0.1_m5stack_arm64.deb
```

Package layout:

| Path | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `/usr/bin/harrison_test` | Application executable. |
| `/usr/share/harrison_test/` | Runtime assets: fonts, images, audio. |
| `/usr/share/APPLaunch/applications/harrison_test.desktop` | APPLaunch launcher entry. |
| `/usr/share/APPLaunch/share/images/harrison_test*.png` | APPLaunch launcher icons/fallbacks. |
| `/usr/lib/systemd/system/harrison_test.service` | Optional systemd service for embedded autostart. |
| `/usr/share/doc/harrison_test/` | README and third-party asset license notes. |

Build and package:

```shell
cmake --preset cp0-cross
cmake --build --preset cp0-cross-rel
cpack --preset cp0-cross-deb
```

Or run the full configure, release build, and package flow with one workflow preset:

```shell
cmake --workflow --preset cp0-cross-package
```

> [!NOTE]
> Use Debian based Linux host with CPack generator 
> as other OS may not resolve the dependencies correctly
> no full dpkg, dpkg-shlibdeps, objdump and readelf support
